Report from the Apache Cordova committee [Shazron Abdullah]

## Description: 

A platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
   
## Activity: 

Current releases have been voted on according to the Apache vote policy. We had two major platform releases - cordova-ios-4.0.0 and cordova-android-5.0.0, including minor updates to cordova-windows@4.2.0 (back button handling) and cordova-ios@3.9.2 (iOS 9 support).

cordova-ios@4.0.0 brings anticipated WKWebView support to the platform (as well as a pluggable webview architecture), while cordova-android@5.0.0 brought Android Marshmallow permission checking in plugins.

Apache Cordova contributors also had a face to face meeting at the Microsoft Campus in Redmond, WA, USA from Oct 14-15, 2015 -- where we discussed and planned the future of the project. Proposals discussed there have been reported back to the dev@c.a.o mailing list and most of them have been acted upon.

   
## Health report: 

After the summer vacation period was over, activity has picked up, although we had a significantly lower number of releases from last quarter (37 vs 45). For this period, we again managed only one overall plugins release (of 22 plugins) when our goal was to have one plugins release per week, although we had individual plugin releases as well.
   
## Issues: 

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
