Report from the Apache Cordova committee [Shazron Abdullah]

## Description: 

   A platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and 
   JavaScript. 
   
## Activity: 

Current releases have been voted on according to the Apache vote policy. We missed the target of releasing the cordova-ios 4.0.0 platform this quarter (but released minor versions 3.9.0 and 3.9.1), and are actively working on updating our other platform versions for the upcoming quarter.

We released a new platform, cordova-browser@4.0.0, and minor updates for cordova-android and cordova-windows. We have two platforms that have been revived after being inactive for some time -- cordova-webos@3.7.0 and cordova-blackberry10@3.8.0.
    
We also renamed and moved all our core plugins to npm (node package manager - npmjs.org), and set the Cordova Plugins Registry (c.p.r) to read-only, with a shut-down date tentatively set for October 15th, 2015. Users that use the old plugin ids from the c.p.r are re-directed to npm automatically from our cordova-cli.
   
## Health report: 

Due to the summer vacation period, activity is slower than usual especially on release of plugins, although we had essentially the same number of releases from last quarter (45 vs 46). For this period, we managed only one overall plugins release (of 22 plugins) when our goal was to have one plugins release per week.
