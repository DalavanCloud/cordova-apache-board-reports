## Description: 
A platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Issues: 
There are no issues requiring Board attention at this time.

## Activity: 
 The iOS platform had one minor and one patch release, and the Android platform had a major and minor release,  while the Windows platform only had one patch (bug fix) release. 

The Android platform major release (6.0.0) includes full support for Android 7.0 Nougat (API 24) while Ice Cream Sandwich (4.0) support was deprecated.

The iOS platform minor release (4.3.0) includes support for CocoaPods in plugins, and also support for Xcode 8.

The Windows platform patch release (4.4.3) fixes some major issues with application activation, splashscreen and VS project generation.

We also had one Tools (CLI 6.4.0 and supporting libraries) release that deprecates node.js 0.x support (we will only support node.js 4.x and above starting next year), and it also includes other new features to config.xml, plus bug fixes.

There were two overall plugin releases this quarter. An overall plugin release usually consists of all, if not most, of our 22 plugins.
   
## Health report: 

Our status dashboard at http://status.cordova.io is mostly all green. The badges that are red are known issues of the CI environment that we are tracking in various JIRA issues.

We are actively trying to improve our testing -- we are trying to automate more manual tests, and streamlining tests across the board since the number of active contributors has dropped off. The drop off (as discussed in the last report) is due to a large number of active contributors from a major vendor being moved off the Apache Cordova project.

We still have a huge backlog of Github Pull Request activity. At last estimate we had less than 150 pull requests in total, across our 60+ git repos. We are actively trying to prune the PRs by closing out stale issues or issues that cannot merge cleanly. It is harder to do so since we do not have write access to Github to close or label PRs, due to Github's limited repo access granularity. We can only clean up PRs using specially constructed empty commit messages as suggested by INFRA, but there is no facility to label PRs for organization.

Our goal for plugins release is to have one per week as a cadence, and we have failed to do so again this quarter. We are working on streamlining this so it will be easier for release managers to package releases.
