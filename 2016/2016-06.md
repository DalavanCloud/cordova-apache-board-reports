Report from the Apache Cordova committee [Shazron Abdullah]

## Description: 

A platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

## Issues: 

There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.

## Activity: 

 We had three patch platform releases: iOS, Ubuntu and Windows.
 Windows had one minor platform release, version 4.4.0, which included significant improvements and features.

There were also 27 plugin releases, and minor cordova-cli releases (6.1.0 and 6.2.0), which includes an improvement that allows for plugin developers to give a mapping of plugin releases to project requirements, greatly enhancing plugin compatibility for platform and cli versions. We also released an improved documentation search update on http://cordova.apache.org
   
## Health report: 

For this period, we managed two overall plugins releases (same as last quarter) when our goal was to have one plugins release per week, although we had individual plugin releases as well. We had a slight decrease (27 vs 34) of plugins that were released this quarter versus last quarter.
