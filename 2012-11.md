Cordova
-------

Apache Cordova is a platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

Status
======

Post graduation development cadence remains verystrong. Work remains to complete migration from incubator infra. 

Community
=========

- Our incubator infra to tlp infra migration ongoing.
- There is concern that it has been difficult for our members to help infra. Cordova required git post-commit hooks to wire CI. Ended up writing our own server on a community members own hardware to poll our git repos to facilitate after multiple attempts working w/ infra to set this up.
- Cordova documentation is currently *not* hosted on Cordova project website but rather a downstream distribution site. (Nor has project website been migrated from incubator domain so expect to fix this in one go.)
- There has been some minor confusion with the CLAs and the account request mechanism. We will refine our project contribution guidelines to make this process more clear.

Releases
========

We have cut two official releases as an Apache project and expect our third this month.
