### We want to add a developer as a committer, and consequently the PMC (our project rule). What does the PMC chair have to do?

File a new issue in the [new_committer_and_pmc repo](https://github.com/cordova/new_committer_and_pmc).

### Generating/Calculating Stats for Board Reports:

For example, if doing the board report for September, you should tally the numbers for the previous 3 months of Aug, July and June (exclude the current reporting month).

- commits: count the # of emails in the [commits@ mailing list](https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/cordova-commits/)
- emails: count the # of emails in the [dev@ mailing list](https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/cordova-dev/)
- issues/comments on issues: count the # of emails in the [issues@ mailing list](https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/cordova-issues/)
- iCLAs: counting them in [private@](https://mail-search.apache.org/pmc/private-arch/cordova-private/), filtered. Note that only Apache Members can search this type of list, PMC members (even Chairs), cannot -- so you will have to search your own private email archive.
- downloads: [cordova stats on npm](http://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=cordova)
