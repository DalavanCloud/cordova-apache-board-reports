### Search for a Committer

### Change the PMC Chair:

### We want to add a developer as a committer, and consequently the PMC (our project rule). What does the PMC chair have to do?

1. Adding a new Committer (by any PMC member): [https://community.apache.org/newcommitter.html](https://community.apache.org/newcommitter.html)
2. Adding a new PMC member (by any PMC member): [http://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#newpmc](http://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html#newpmc), wait 72 hours for any Board objections
3. Create a New Account Request (PMC Chair only): [https://id.apache.org/acreq/](https://id.apache.org/acreq/)
4. Update (by any PMC member) [https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers/board/committee-info.txt](https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers/board/committee-info.txt) with the new PMC member's details and the effective join date (date of [NOTICE]).
5. ssh (PMC Chair only) to [people.apache.org](ssh://people.apache.org) then:

        modify_committee.pl {project} --add id
        
**All five steps have to be done properly to fulfill all Apache Board requirements (you'll get a reminder eventually if you did anything wrong).**

Optionally, you might want to automatically [ subscribe the new PMC member to the private list.](http://untroubled.org/ezmlm/manual/Remote-Administration.html)
