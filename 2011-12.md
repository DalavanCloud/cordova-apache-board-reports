Status report for the Apache Callback project - Dec 2011

Project Status
--------------

Infrastructure migration still underway; the only major sticking point is that GIT is crucially important for our community and workflow. Additionally we have voted to rename the project to "Cordova". 

We are contributing to the CouchDB project documentation that descibes use and, more importantly, the cutting of Apache releases from Git infrastructure. Our goal is to bring our project to that infrastructure, and we recognize its our resonsability to ensure the goals of legal and community at Apache do not suffer for it.

The name "Callback" was suboptimal for findability, and worse, authored documentation relating to the JavaScript interfaces found in the project. Cordova was the street of the old Nitobi office wherein the PhoneGap project was conceived and has some community precident in another related tooling project. Discussion was positive, and the vote nearly unanamious. We now need to address infra to engage the rename work (and probably send em a bottle in thanks for being a pain the ass).


Community
---------

* Community is growing with documentation traffic, and downloadss, up.
* The mailing list has been super active with new community members.
* Jira embraced however we are still getting issues logged on
  Github. Committers are using Github as a funnel to capture issues,
still, and manually moving them to Jira once vetted.
* GIT infrastructure remains to be setup.
* Renaming needs to be promoted.

Community Objectives
--------------------

* Migrate to the name Cordova and update the community appropriately.
* Continue to assist in documentation effort for CouchDB use of Git.
