## Description: 

 A platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
   
## Issues: 
 
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 

We had eight platform releases - four patch release for iOS (4.5.1, 4.5.2, 4.5.3, 4.5.4), one patch release for Browser (5.0.1), two minor and one major release for Android (6.3.0, 6.4.0, 7.0.0). The iOS and Browser releases were just small bug fixes. The Android release now brings our Android project structure to based of the Android Studio project structure. 

We had many plugins gets released. Most notable is that we have deprecated `cordova-plugin-file-transfer`, `cordova-plugin-globalization`, `cordova-plugin-contacts` and `cordova-plugin-compat`. Due to `cordova-plugin-compat` being deprecated, we removed it as a dependency for a handful of plugins and gave them major version bumps. 

Cordova-cli@7.1.0 was also released. This was accompanied by releases in other tools that the CLI is composed of.

## Health report: 

Our status dashboard at http://status.cordova.io is mostly all green.

We still have a huge backlog of GitHub Pull Request activity, again, same as last quarter -- but it has improved. Infra has now moved over all of our git repos to GitHub. This allows us to properly label pull requests. We also have the ability to merge in pull requests via the website. 

We are in the process of deprecating a few of our plugins which can be replaced by official W3C specs which have been implemented in the browsers of the platforms we support. We are also in the process of integrating a couple of plugins back into platforms and deprecating the plugins. This will help ease the maintenance load on the team. 

We have attempted to contact Cocoon.io folks multiple times about using the cordova trademark incorrectly. We didn't get a response but they appear to have made the changes we suggested and are now compliant.
