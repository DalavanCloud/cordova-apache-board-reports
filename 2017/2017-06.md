## Description: 

 A platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
   
## Issues: 
 
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 
 There was one overall plugin release this quarter. An overall plugin release usually consists of all, if not most, of our 23 plugins. This number was one less than last quarter.

We had two platform releases - one minor plus three patch releases for Android (6.2.0, 6.2.1, 6.2.2, 6.2.3) and one minor release for iOS (4.4.0). Android releases were to fix two consecutive major breaks in Android tools releases (deprecation of certain Android SDK tools). The minor iOS release was to support Carthage, breakage while using Xcode 8.3.2, and also dynamic frameworks.

We had a major tools release of the CLI version 7.0.0 with support for custom platforms, increased package.json support, and dropping of support for older platform versions.

We had a new plugin release - cordova-plugin-screen-orientation 2.0.0, as well as a new developer tool release, cordova-coho 1.0.0. 

## Health report: 

Our status dashboard at http://status.cordova.io is mostly all green. Travis CI pull request has been vastly improved versus last quarter due to INFRA enabling certain changes. Previously pull requests may have taken 24 hours but now it happens within 15 minutes. 

Our plugin device testing has been put on hold since a major contributor has decided to not support the server we have been testing on, resulting in a lot of "broken" build status badges on the status page. To resolve this,  we are moving the testing to AppVeyor and Travis CI, and have filed an INFRA issue for help: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-14273

We still have a huge backlog of Github Pull Request activity, again, same as last quarter -- but it has improved. We would have liked to have direct access to Github to manage these issues better and have request Gitbox access but there hasn't been a response so far: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/INFRA-14347 

Again, our goal for plugins release is to have one per week as a cadence, and we have failed to do so again this quarter. We have done work on streamlining this so it will improve in the future.
