## Description: 

 A platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
   
## Issues: 
 
 There are no issues requiring board attention at this time.
   
## Activity: 

We had four platform releases - two patch release for Browser (5.0.2, 5.0.3), one minor release for Android (7.1.0) and one major release for Windows (6.0.0) The Android and Browser releases were just small bug fixes. The Windows release now suppoorts the latest version of visual studio and does Windows 10 builds by default. 

We had many plugins gets released. Many of the releases needed second releases due to issues with installing from npm due to us forgetting to update some fields.

Cordova-cli@8.0.0 was also released. This was accompanied by releases in other tools that the CLI is composed of. We took the release of this major version to drop deprecated code. 

## Health report: 

Our status dashboard at http://status.cordova.io is mostly all green.

We still have a huge backlog of GitHub Pull Request activity, again, same as last quarter. Will keep chipping away.
