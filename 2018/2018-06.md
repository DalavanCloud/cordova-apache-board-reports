## Description: 
 - A platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
   
## Issues: 
  - There are no issues requiring board attention at this time. 
  
## Activity: 
 - TODO - the PMC MUST provide this information 
   
## Health report: 
Our status dashboard at http://status.cordova.io is mostly all green.

We still have a huge backlog of GitHub Pull Request activity, again, same as last quarter. We have started migrating from JIRA to Github Issues (starting with cordova-docs) to perhaps take advantage of some automation available through Github apps.
