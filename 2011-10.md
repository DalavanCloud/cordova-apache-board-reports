Status report for the Apache Callback project - Nov 2011

Project Status
--------------

Infrastructure migration still underway; the only major sticking point is that GIT is crucially important for our community and workflow. Debate has re-ignited over the name, with concern that "Callback" is too common/possibly ambiguous.

Community
---------

* Project commits have, understandably, slowed with the move to new infrastructure.
* Community is growing with documentation traffic, and downloadss, up.
* The mailing list has been super active with new community members.
* Jira embraced immediatey and seeing good use.
* GIT infrastructure remains to be setup.
* Project name under question but healthy debate happening on list.

Community Objectives
--------------------

* resolve the name (be it Callback or otherwise)
* rename of project assets to Apache namespace addition of the Apache license to all code headers
* updating docs w/ a guide for contributer workflow under Apache
* Legal review of src.
